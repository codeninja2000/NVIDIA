start

:Load the pre-trained model;
if (Custom module required?) then (Yes)
    :Import `MyConvBlock` from `nv_utils.py`;
else (No)
    :Proceed;
endif

:Load an image from `data/asl_images`;
:Display the image using `matplotlib`;

:Preprocess the image;
note right
Preprocessing steps:
1. Convert to grayscale
2. Resize to 28x28
3. Normalize to [0, 1]
end note

:Batch the image (add batch dimension);
:Move the image to the same device as the model;

:Pass the image to the model for inference;
:Obtain the output (24-length array);

:Find the index of the highest probability using `argmax`;
:Map the index to the corresponding letter;
