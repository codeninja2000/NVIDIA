:Load ASL dataset;
:Preprocess images;
:Apply data augmentation techniques;
:Normalize image data;
:Split dataset into training & validation sets;

if (GPU available?) then (Yes)
  :Set device to CUDA;
else (No)
  :Set device to CPU;
endif

:Define convolutional neural network (CNN);
:Compile model with optimizer and loss function;

repeat
  :Train model on augmented dataset;
  :Validate using test data;
 
repeat while (epoch < 20);

:Evaluate model performance;
:Save trained model for deployment;
