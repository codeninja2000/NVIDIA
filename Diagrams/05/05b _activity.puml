start

:Load Pre-trained VGG16 Model;
:Move Model to Device (CPU/GPU);

:Freeze Pre-trained Layers;
:Add New Layers for Binary Classification;

:Prepare Dataset;
note right
Dataset Preparation:
1. Load images of "Bo" and "Not Bo"
2. Apply preprocessing (resize, normalize, etc.)
3. Create DataLoaders
end note

:Train the Model;
note right
Training Steps:
1. Use Binary Cross Entropy Loss
2. Apply Data Augmentation
3. Train only new layers
end note

:Validate the Model;

if (Fine-tuning Needed?) then (Yes)
    :Unfreeze Pre-trained Layers;
    :Fine-tune Model with Small Learning Rate;
else (No)
    :Skip Fine-tuning;
endif

:Make Predictions;
note right
Prediction Steps:
1. Preprocess input image
2. Pass image through the model
3. Interpret output (negative = Bo, positive = Not Bo)
end note

:Implement Doggy Door Logic;
if (Prediction < 0) then (Yes)
    :Allow Bo to Enter;
else (No)
    :Deny Entry;
endif
